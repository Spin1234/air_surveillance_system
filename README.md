# air_surveillance_system

### The purpose of this system is to detect any aircraft within a specified airspace range based on latitude and longitude

We have a latitude and longitude, now we want a bounding box of R km range around the base latitude and longitude. In order to calculate the bounding box we need four points, those four points are latitude minimum, latitude maximum, longitude minimum and longitude maximum. Here is the mathematical concepts and calculations to get those four points to get the bounding box:
